Props
 pass infomation to a Component using props 

 pass props to any component as we declare

 attributes for any HTML tag
 <ChildComp pops1 = "Hello" />
 State is private to a component and can only be
 accessed by it.

 Props are passed by a parent to a child component
 
 State can be modified,where as props are read
 only
 It is an approach where state is shared between different
 components.
 
 The common approach is to move the state to the common parent
 of the two components.

 The state is shared via props to the child components.

 With shared state,changes in state reflect in relevent 
 component simultaneously.

 There is a single source of truth for shared state component

 In React, a single source of truth refers to the concept 
that there should be one central place in your application
where you store the data and state of your application, 
and that this data should be the source of truth for all 
components that need to access and display it. This helps
to ensure that all components have access to the same,
up-to-date information, and that changes made in one place
are reflected consistently throughout the application
